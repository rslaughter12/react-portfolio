# React Portfolio 

## Overview
* This project was to create a portfolio using React. In my portfolio I have a home page, a portfolio page, and a contact page. The portfolio page has links to my deployed projects and the contact page has a form to contact me.

## Description
This project's main purpose is to create a professional portfolio using React front end library. This is a resource that I can use when applying for jobs in the future and can use to showcase the skills that I have as well as reasons why I would be a good fit for a company. The portfolio is deployed on GitHub pages.
## User Story
* AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
* I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
* SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
